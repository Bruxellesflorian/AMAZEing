# What was asked ?

## Let's build a simple Maze program

- Type of challenge: **consolidation**  
- Duration: **2-3 days**  
- Team challenge: **solo**
- Deadline: **25/11/2020 19:00**


# What did we do ?

In this exercise I created a maze.
I had to create a program capable of generating a map from a code:  

 ```***********.*   
*S.....**.*.T    
*****.....*.*  
*****.***.*.*  
*****.*****.*  
*****.*****.*  
*****.......*  
*****.*******  
*.........***  
*.******...**  
*....********
```   

# What are the bugs?

* I didn't manage to generate a new level

# What works?

* All levels can be generated 
* The character moves
* The character is stopped by the walls
* The end of the route signals an alert
* A timer is integrated 



# What did we use ?
* HTML5
* JavaScript
* CSS3
